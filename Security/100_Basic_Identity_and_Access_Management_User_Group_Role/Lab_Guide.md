# Level 100: Basic Identity and Access Management User, Group, Role: Lab Guide

## 1. AWS Identity & Access Management

As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it's not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access. Then make those users administrators (only if they absolutely need full access to everything) by placing the users into an "Administrators" group to which you attach the AdministratorAccess managed policy.

The following image shows what you will be doing in the next section 1.1 Create Administrator IAM User and Group.

### 1.1 Create Administrator IAM User and Group

To create an administrator user for yourself and add the user to an administrators group:

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the AWS account root user to the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the navigation pane, click **Users** and then click **Add user**.

![iam-create-user](Images/iam-create-user.png)

3. For *User name*, type a user name for yourself, such as Bob or Alice. Each user should have their own user name, do not share credentials. The name can consist of letters, digits, and the following characters: plus `(+)`, equal `(=)`, comma `(,)`, period `(.)`, at `(@)`, underscore `(_)`, and hyphen `(-)`. The name is not case sensitive and can be a maximum of 64 characters in length.
4. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**, select **Custom password**, and then type your new password in the text box. This user will be able to do almost anything in your account, by not giving it programmatic access (access & secret key) you reduce your risk, and we will configure lower-privileged users and roles later. If you're creating the user for someone other than yourself, you can optionally select Require password reset to force the user to create a new password when first signing in.

5. Click **Next: Permissions**.
6. On the Set permissions for user page, click **Add user to group**.
7. Click **Create group**.
8. In the Create group dialog box, type the name for the new group such as **Admins**. The name can consist of letters, digits, and the following characters: `plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at (@), underscore (_), and hyphen (-).` The name is not case sensitive and can be a maximum of 128 characters in length.
9. In the policy list, select the check box next to **ReadOnlyAccess**. Then click **Create group**.

10. Back in the list of groups, verify the check box is next to your new group. Click **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list.

![iam-add-user-3](Images/iam-add-user-3.png)

11. Click **Next: Tags**. For this lab we will not add tags to the user.
12. Click **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, click Create user.

![iam-add-user-4](Images/iam-add-user-4.png)

You can use this same process to create more groups and users and to give your users access to your AWS account resources. To learn about using policies that restrict user permissions to specific AWS resources, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html). To add users to the group after it's created, see [Adding and Removing Users in an IAM Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_add-remove-users.html).

13. Configure MFA on your new administrator user by choosing **Users** from the navigation pane.
14. In the User Name list, click the name of the intended MFA user.
15. Click the **Security credentials** tab. Next to **Assigned MFA device**, click the **edit** icon.

![iam-user-mfa](Images/iam-user-mfa.png)

16. You can now use this administrator user instead of your root user for this AWS account. It is a best practice to use least privileged access approach to granting permissions, not everyone needs full administrator access!

The following image shows what you will be doing in the next section 1.2 Create Administrator IAM Role.

![iam-create-user&group](Images/iam-create-role.png)

### 1.2 Create Administrator IAM Role

To create an administrator role for yourself (and other administrators) to be used with the administrator user and group you just created:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the navigation pane, click **Roles** and then click **Create role**.
3. Click Another AWS account, then enter your account ID and tick **Require MFA**, then click **Next: Permissions**

![iam-role-1](Images/iam-role-create-1.png)

4. Tick AdministratorAccess from the list, and then click **Next: Tags**.
5. Click **Next: Review**

![iam-role-2](Images/iam-role-create-2.png)

5. Enter a role name, e.g. 'AdminRole' then click **Create role**.

![iam-role-3](Images/iam-role-create-3.png)

6. Check the role you have configured by clicking the role you have just created. Record both the Role ARN and the link to the console. You can also optionally change the session duration timeout. ![iam-role-created](Images/iam-role-created.png)
6. The role is now created, with full administrative access and MFA enforced.

### 1.3 Allow user 'Bob' to assume Administrator Role

1. Once user Bob is created go back to the IAM Console and select **Groups** to find the **Admins** group you created in last step. Select the group and go to **Permissions** tab and **Inline Policies**. Click on **To create one, click here**.
Select **Customer Policy** and **Select**. Set Policy Name as **AssumeRole** and in the Policy Document paste following after putting your own account ID:

`{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:role/AdminRole"
  }
}`

## 2. Assume Administrator Role from an IAM user

We will assume the role using the IAM user that we previously created in the web console. As the IAM user has full access it is a best practice not to have access keys to assume the role on the CLI, instead we should use a restricted IAM user for this so we can enforce the requirement of MFA.

The following image shows what you will be doing in the next section 2.1 Use Administrator Role in Web Console.

![iam-create-user&group](Images/iam-switch-role.png)

### 2.1 Use Administrator Role in Web Console

A *role* specifies a set of permissions that you can use to access AWS resources that you need. In that sense, it is similar to a user in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). A benefit of roles is they allow you to enforce the use of an MFA token to help protect your credentials. When you sign in as a user, you get a specific set of permissions. However, you don't sign in to a role, but once signed in (as a user) you can switch to a role. This temporarily sets aside your original user permissions and instead gives you the permissions assigned to the role. The role can be in your own account or any other AWS account. By default, your AWS Management Console session lasts for one hour.

  **Important**

    The permissions of your IAM user and any roles that you switch to are not cumulative. Only one set of permissions is active at a time. When you switch to a role, you temporarily give up your user permissions and work with the permissions that are assigned to the role. When you exit the role, your user permissions are automatically restored.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. In the console, click your user name on the navigation bar in the upper right. It typically looks like this: `username@account_ID_number_or_alias`. Alternatively you can paste the link in your browser that you recorded earlier.
3. Click Switch Role. If this is the first time choosing this option, a page appears with more information. After reading it, click Switch Role. If you clear your browser cookies, this page can appear again.

![switch-role](Images/switch-role.png)

4. On the Switch Role page, type the account ID number or the account alias in the **Account** field, and the name of the role that you created for the Administrator in the **Role** field.
5. (Optional) Type text that you want to appear on the navigation bar in place of your user name when this role is active. A name is suggested, based on the account and role information, but you can change it to whatever has meaning for you. You can also select a color to highlight the display name. The name and color can help remind you when this role is active, which changes your permissions. For example, for a role that gives you access to the test environment, you might specify a Display Name of Test and select the green Color. For the role that gives you access to production, you might specify a Display Name of Production and select red as the Color.
6. Click Switch Role. The display name and color replace your user name on the navigation bar, and you can start using the permissions that the role grants you.

    **Tip**

   The last several roles that you used appear on the menu. The next time you need to switch to one of those roles, you can simply click the role you want. You only need to type the account and role information manually if the role is not displayed on the Identity menu.

7. You are now using the role with the granted permissions!

   **To stop using a role**
   In the IAM console, click your role's Display Name on the right side of the navigation bar. Click Back to UserName. The role and its permissions are deactivated, and the permissions associated with your IAM user and groups are automatically restored.
